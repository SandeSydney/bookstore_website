# bookstore_website
This is a simple website, done majorly for a small to an average bookstore. 
Main aim is to learn php stepwise and apply it here.
It involves most (if not all) of php's features. necessary help shall be appreciated.
The idea behind this project is promoting the marketing of the products offered at the afore-mentioned store.
The site includes an appealing UI that will make users stay put and attract them to make purchases and subscriptions.
